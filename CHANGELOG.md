# Changelog

All notable changes to agent-tether will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete rewrite as a standalone library.
- Replaced `Handlers` callback model with `BridgeInterface` abstract base class (push model)
- Replaced `BridgeBase` with platform-specific implementations (`TelegramBridge`, `SlackBridge`, `DiscordBridge`)
- Removed `Runner`, `RunnerEvents`, `RunnerRegistry` (runner protocol)
- Removed standalone formatting, approval, batching, debounce, and router modules. All logic is now in `BridgeInterface` or platform implementations.
- Replaced all internal HTTP calls with `BridgeCallbacks`, a dataclass of async functions provided by the host application. No more `httpx` dependency or assumption of a localhost API server.
- Removed `api_port` and `api_token` from `BridgeConfig`
- Switched from stdlib `logging` to `structlog`

### Added
- `BridgeCallbacks` dataclass with 10 async callback slots (`create_session`, `send_input`, `stop_session`, `respond_to_permission`, `list_sessions`, `get_usage`, `check_directory`, `list_external_sessions`, `get_external_history`, `attach_external`)
- `BridgeInterface` with shared helpers: auto-approve timers, approval/choice text parsing, error debouncing, notification batching, external session pagination, formatting
- `BridgeManager` for multi-platform event routing
- `BridgeSubscriber` for consuming store events and forwarding to bridges
- `BridgeConfig` for configuration (data directory, default adapter, error debounce)
- Callbacks for store integration (`GetSessionDirectory`, `GetSessionInfo`, `OnSessionBound`)
- Telegram `StateManager` for session-to-topic persistence
- Discord `DiscordPairingState` for pairing code management
- `thread_state` module for lightweight thread name persistence
- Full command handling in all three bridges (help, status, list, attach, new, stop, usage)

### Removed
- `httpx` dependency (replaced by `BridgeCallbacks`)
- `agent_tether.runner` module (Runner protocol, RunnerEvents, RunnerRegistry, RunnerUnavailableError)
- `agent_tether.models` module (Handlers, CommandDef, ApprovalRequest moved to base)
- `agent_tether.platforms` package (replaced by top-level telegram/slack/discord packages)
- `agent_tether.approval`, `agent_tether.batching`, `agent_tether.debounce`, `agent_tether.formatting`, `agent_tether.router`, `agent_tether.state` modules

  - `RunnerEvents` protocol with 10 event callbacks
  - `RunnerRegistry` for factory-based runner creation
  - `RunnerUnavailableError` exception
